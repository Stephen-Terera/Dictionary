# Dictionary
Dictionary Project. This was another project that was part of a Udemy course that I undertook. It is a simple dictionary program and takes a word from a user and outputs the meaning of that word. Not all the words in the dictionary are part of the data as this was just a project to work on the python skills rather
than to make an actual working application for commercial use.
If a word was entered and was not reconized then the program would make a suggestion on what the user could possibly mean and they could enter yes or no. If the
aswer was yes than the meaning of the suggested word would be displayed , if no then the program would inform the user that the meaning of that word is not 
know.
